Codes for: Transformer Fault Prognosis Using Deep Recurrent Neural Network Over Vibration Signals (under review)

Vibration   analysis   is   considered   as   a   cost-efficient  and  non-destructive  technique  to  monitor  the  transformer    operating    conditions    and    evaluate    the    transformer  mechanical  integrity.  This  method  enables  transformer  fault  prognosis  before  insulation  catastrophic  failure.  In  this  work,  the  possibility  of  using  deep  neural  networks  in  capturing  the  hidden  patterns  of  vibration  time-series  to  predict  the  transformer  under  and  over  excitation and inter-turn fault progress prediction in early stages  is  examined.  This  focus  is  warranted  because  deep  learning   techniques   lend   themselves   to   integrating   the   feature  extraction  into  the  predictive  model  construction  stage.   In   this   regard,   deep   recurrent   neural   network   (RNN)      architecture      including      unidirectional      and      bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRUs) and long short-term    memory    (LSTM)    models    are    adopted.    The    constructed RNN for predicting excitation voltage exhibits a remarkable performance with a Relative Absolute Error of  0.56%.  Predicting  the  inter-turn  fault  proved  to  be  a  more  challenging  problem  and  the  constructed  RNN  for  this  purpose  showed  an  RAE  of  17.58%.
